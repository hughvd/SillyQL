# SillyQL
A relational database language created entirely from scratch, coded in C++.

This project provides a set of functions that mimic some of the basic operations of SQL. These are ideal for those looking to understand the underlying mechanics of database operations without diving deep into a full-fledged SQL environment. Use of this project is to be done through the command line.

## **Functions**  
Database commands:
1. CREATE  
Description: Creates a new table with N columns (where N > 0). Each column contains data of type <coltype> and is accessed with the name <colname>. Table names and column names are guaranteed to be space-free. No two columns in the same table will have the same name (you do not need to check). Valid data types for coltype are {double, int, bool, string}. This table is initially empty.  
Syntax: ```CREATE <tablename> <N> <coltype1> <coltype2> ... <coltypeN> <colname1> <colname2> ... <colnameN>```  
2. QUIT  
Description: Clears up allocated memory.  
3. REMOVE  
Description: Remove existing table from the database, deleting all data in the table and its definition.  
Syntax: ```REMOVE <tablename>```  

Table commands:
1. INSERT  
Description: Adds a new row of data to a specified table.   
Syntax:  
```
INSERT INTO <tablename> <N> ROWS  
<value11> <value12> ... <value1M>  
<value21> <value22> ... <value2M>  
...  
<valueN1> <valueN2> ... <valueNM>
```  
3. PRINT  
Description: Displays the content of a specified table. Can choose to print specified rows using WHERE or the entire table using ALL  
Syntax: ```PRINT FROM <tablename> <N> <print_colname1> <print_colname2> ... <print_colnameN> {WHERE <colname> <OP> <value> | ALL}```  
4. DELETE
Description: Delete selected rows from the specified table.  
Syntax: ```DELETE FROM <tablename> WHERE <colname> <OP> <value>```  
5. JOIN  
Description: Join two tables where values in selected columns match, and print results.  
Syntax: ```JOIN <tablename1> AND <tablename2> WHERE <colname1> = <colname2> AND PRINT <N> <print_colname1> <1|2> <print_colname2> <1|2> ... <print_colnameN> <1|2>```  
9. GENERATE  
Description: Directs the program to create an index of the type <indextype> on the column <colname> in the table <tablename>, where <indextype> is strictly limited to the set {hash, bst}, denoting a hash table index and a binary search tree index respectively. 
Syntax: ```GENERATE FOR <tablename> <indextype> INDEX ON <colname>```   

Getting Started  
To use these functions, navigate to the directory where the files are contained. To generate an executable, run ```make silly```. Then to run it type ```./silly.exe```
